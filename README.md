# Software-Design-Doc

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
# The Gaming Room is a small company that creates games for users to play with each other. They are primarly focused on  the mobile market but have been expanding into web-based platforms.
# The Gaming Room wanted to integrate their mobile game "Draw It Or Lose It" to a web-based platform and have cross-play compatibilty.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
# I did exceptionally well understanding what the client wanted from me and describing what would be required for the process of fulfilling their objective.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
# I found always having reference points to look back on to figure out what I should be doing and what needs to be accomplished in order to achieve the goal of the client. By working through the design document, I never felt lost and always had a guide to keep me on track.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
# I would revise the section explaining the differences between platforms. I don't believe I sufficiently explained the differences enough for an untrained eye to understand why these platforms are different and why this choice is important. I would delve deeper into these differences and try to pick out key details on what seperates these platforms from one another.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
# I took the simple approach of putting myself in the shoes of the consumer. What would I want from an application? In this case, it's a game so having access to social features and profile settings is crucial. It's important to consider the user when designing software because if people are going to use an application, having it work is only half of what's important. Ease of use, giving the user features they would want is equally important. If you make an application that works but is hard to use, is not up to par with competitors, then it will quickly become obsolete. 

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
# To build opon my previous answer, I try to imagine what features would be expected in a multiplayer game and go from there. If new ideas emerge that are easy to implent and serve a good purpose, all the better. A key question I both kept in mind and what I would keep in the mind in the future is "what makes our software stand out? Why pick ours over a competitor?"  Then ideas and features are built upon that question and a product that can stand out from the others can be created as a result.
